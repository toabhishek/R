4. select variables containing mean and standard deviation from xmerge and store in dataframe 'mean_std_data'


5. reading y_test and y_train datasets adding the two datasets in row-wise in dataframe 'ymerge' 


6. reading activity labels and replace ymerge variables with activity descriptions


7. adding column in mean_std_data with activity descriptions


8. grouping data by activity and studentID, and averaging each variable

9. return final data file
